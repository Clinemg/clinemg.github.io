      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Are you tired of reading the same books over and over again, or just finished a book and are looking for a new one to fill the void? Never struggle to find a book again! I am starting a site that reviews books! It will be a spot where people can find, rate, and leave reviews on books. You can find books you like, and recommend them to other readers so they can enjoy them too! Don’t hesitate, and visit to begin a new reading Journey! </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The site will serve as a search engine for book people who are looking for new books and as a review site for the books people are searching for. Reviews will be provided by readers. My audience will be for people from ages 18 - 60. 18 because not all books are kid friendly and 60 because most people older than that don’t like or don't understand technology. As such, books for children under the age of 10 will not be included.  </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        It will be a page with an opening picture and justification for the site’s existence.  Will show the most recent updates and most recent additions to the list. In addition to navigation, there will be paragraphs about each of the sub pages and a button that will take you to the sub page in question. Those paragraphs will be about what can be done on each page and basic instructions for how to do it. Near the bottom, I may include an about us and a method of contacting me as the creator of the site.

      </ul>
      <h3>Book Search</h3>
      <p>
        This page will be where the book information is actually located. It will include a full list of the books on the site. It will include book titles, authors, pictures of books (hopefully) and reviews (hopefully). Pictures of books may be unfindable and reviews may have to be dealt with separately depending on how much knowledge I have at the point of construction.  If possible (meaning if I am able to figure out how to do it) I will include a search function complete with tags and themes. I will probably only add a few books for the assignment. Eventually, I would like to find a database of books to link my site to.

      </ul>
      <h3>Genre Definitions</h3>
      <p>
        There are a lot of genres and a concept I have run into a lot recently is that there are people who don’t understand or are not aware of things that I consider to be common sense. Based on that, I think that there should be a page that defines different genres and maybe links one or two books from that genre as examples. They should be fairly detailed descriptions and should use low level language so people don’t have to google words in order to partially understand. Because of the number of books I am planning on, I may have a genre that doesn’t have any books that will fit in that category.
